This is a simple calculator in c# using Windows Forms(.NET framework 4.7.2) 
I believe you can just download the "Calculator.exe" file(that was manually added, though Windows is always against downloading these kind of files and 
might tell you that it's a virus)
FEATURES: 
* Standard operators
* mod, negation operator
* Backspace
